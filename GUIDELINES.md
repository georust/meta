# Guidelines for GeoRust Projects

## What is a GeoRust project?

GeoRust is a community working to deliver high quality geospatial software
using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), a programming language focused on
performance, reliability, and productivity.

We want to write down some of the expectations for projects within the GeoRust
organization. This document is incomplete by nature. We will work to amend it
in a way that strikes a good balance between addressing pressing concerns while
remaining clear and concise enough that we can expect people to actually read
it.
