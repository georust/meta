# GeoRust Meta

This is the main repository for coordinating and discussing GeoRust projects.
[Open an Issue](https://github.com/georust/team/issues/new) if you have any
question about the GeoRust organization, a GeoRust project, or something else!

## Join Us? 🌍🌏🌎

Many of us can be found lurking in the [GeoRust Discord
server](https://discord.com/channels/598002550221963289). Stop by to ask
questions about Rust and GIS, share your project, your favorite paper, or just
say hello 👋.

**Have a project?** Working on GIS in Rust doesn't have to be lonely. Maybe we
can help. If you have (or want to start!) a Rust project that helps people do
GIS, check out our [Project
Guidelines](https://github.com/georust/meta/blob/master/GUIDELINES.md). If the
guideline make sense to you, [open an
issue](https://github.com/georust/team/issues/new) with your proposal or strike
up a conversation in [our Discord
server](https://discord.com/channels/598002550221963289).
